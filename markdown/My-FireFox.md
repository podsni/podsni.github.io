My Firefox is pretty odd looking, I know.

A few people now have asked about it. I uploaded the one file needed as well as a little instructional guide to gitlab.

[This is the link](https://gitlab.com/hexdsl/dots/tree/master/firefox)

Just read that. I wrote it there, not here. Because it made way more sense to write that on Gitlab, where people will need it. Not here, where no-one reads, as far as I know.
