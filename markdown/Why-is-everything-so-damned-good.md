The reality of all this is that I'm rarely at a loss for things to do. I've had to start making Task-lists in Calcurse just to keep track of it all. And, I'm at the point where I actively DODGE picking up new things to be interested in because its too much.

This is an odd sort of satisfaction to have. While some people I know say dumb shit like "If I won the lottery I would still work, for something to do" or "I can't have more than a few days off work. I'm at a loss for what to do with all the time", I am constantly fighting with all the cool shit in my world and its all wonderful.

If books, comics, TV, Movies, Music and Games were all put on freeze right now, I would have enough stuff to do for the next 100 Years!

I listed all the cool shit I like in this post, on the off chance that you, dear reader may want to look some of this cool shit up. But, the reality is, I think, that you will be making some 'lol's as you read because your list of shit you want to read/watch/play/listen/do is just as long as mine.

We live in an odd time where the rate of "good shit" vastly out paces the rate of "free time we got" and I fear, thinks are only going to get more dense at that 'time' goes on.

Not to mention all the cool shit Ive never even heard about yet

What a wonderful time.
