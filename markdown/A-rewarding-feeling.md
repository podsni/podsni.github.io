One of the things that I enjoy about my online life is that it is both more organised and more productive than my real life. I often make things using my computer but never make things without it.

Some times I take a sit down and think about how my things are going. I have to say, at the moment things, in a creative sense, are very well.

Things that are going on:

* **Visual Novel** I haven't spoken about this too much recently because I worry that I maybe deeply boring but I'm slowly chipping away at the VN, drawing a few scenes each week and adding to the plot. I have decided that even though I fully intend to voice every line, its best done in bulk when I am 100% done with the script. I love how easy Renpy is to work with and I love spending time learning to draw generally, Aseprite is still a good tool that I am enjoying a great deal.

* **YouTube Channel** I have literally NEVER missed an upload. 3 times a week like clockwork since I stopped doing a video a day a few years ago. Not sure if anyone else cares but I am pretty proud of that. At the time of typing this I have 6165 Subscribers and I appreciate how many people watch regularly.

* **Twitch** I treat my Twitch streams as a hobby, not a serious commitment (I am a YouTuber firstly) and I have a blast streaming. I am sometimes low energy, sometimes high energy. Sometimes with friends. I try my best to to put on a 'show' so much as I try to hang out with the people that come and watch. The only time I'm fully in performance mode with streaming is the XPenguin podcast. Because of this I never stop enjoying the streaming but often life gets in my way a lot more than I would like and I have to skip evenings. I try not to beat myself up about it but it needs to be skipped some times for usually good reasons. At time of writing this I have 928 followers on Twitch. Given how relaxed and casual my streams are, I'm a little surprised that so many people press follow.

* **Community** I love Community, making YouTube videos, streaming, hanging out in Discord/IRC - The people I have become friends with on the way have been my reward for all this stuff. Before I made the effort to begin making stuff I was pretty lonely. I spent many a night clicking away at games I didn't care about watching TV shows to kill time. Now, all these years later, I am part of a community. I get to talk to the fiends I have met, talk to new people all the time. I get a bunch of email and comments from people and I feel like I'm constantly running out of time for things. The community of people that have come together around my video and streams have made my life measurably better. Thanks!

* **Patreon** I find it hard to really 'push' the Patreon as it feels strange to be all like "Give me money... for... nothing... no, wait I mean, REASONS!" but I am going to try and mention it consistently at the end of my videos. To be honest, I mention it because I need the money for PC upgrades and other things I really can not afford (I am not a wealthy man, but I am a happy one) I hope this doesn't bother anyone. Oh, and thank you so much to all the people who already support me. I mean it when I say that all support helps me a great deal and I really am grateful!

Well there we have it, that's everything I wanted to sort of mull over now I have essentially reset the Blog here. sooooo.....

**Future plans:** Keep on doing what I'm doing. Have fun. Make new friends and get more views... because every new viewer could be a new friend one day :)

Thank you for taking the time to read (I dont proof read this.... just saying)

Love, Hex.
