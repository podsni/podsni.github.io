Today I test.

This is is not a post. its a test... I am testing right now...

The thing I'm testing is as [THIS THING!](https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop) that Drew made :)

This wonderful thing means I can finally no use LB, a substandard tool that forced me to use HTML when all I wanted in life was to write in Markdown! - Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope this post went well! :)
