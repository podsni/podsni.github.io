I tested Streaming on YouTube. The VOD is set to UNLISTED but is embedded at the bottom of this post for you.

I played Destiny 2 (Stadia) while LinuxPaulM and ChrisWere hung out in chat. It was a good stream, I think.

I had a good time playing the game but setting up a stream on YouTube is a fucking chore! The chat seems laggy and has no time stamps. The final video is was lower quality than the stream was and that really odd!

Either way, I did not enjoy streaming via YouTube. Ill be back on Twitch Tomorrow.

Here's the video:
