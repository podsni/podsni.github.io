<p>Quick update, so that you know for certain that its still a thing!</p>
<p>The audio blog/thoughts/thing I spoke about in a previous post. Yeah that! - Well. It took me a whole damned evening but the system for making it is all done now. Here is the work-flow…</p>
<p>Voice segments are recorded with Android “recorder” application (It’s a Google app that has some Pixel specific features, so I’m using it until I find a better option) It then saves those segments to Google Drive (because there is a button and the point of this whole thing is not fucking around!)</p>
<p>The script, mounts Gdrive, grabs the files. Converts them to the correct format (using sox) then exports them into one mp3, with an intro and a beep between every clip, then an outro. It then deletes all the junk and plops the MP3 in the correct folder for uploading to this very site! - Its basic as fuck but it literally works perfectly for what I want to do!</p>
<p>The uploads themselves will be called (either) Hex Nuggets or Hex Shards. I have to settle on a name for them but at the moment I like Nuggets best as its less pretentious.</p>
<p>The first shard/nugget will be uploaded at some point over the next few days. I expect the first one to be terrible. At the moment its a few clips of sort of half blogs. There’s not really a lot of value to any of them. But, I want this to act as voice log as much as ‘podcast bytes’ and I have to learn what works/doesn’t work with this sort of project.</p>
<p>The few after that will probably be less ‘Bloggy’ and more like half baked Linux/Gaming thoughts that may or may not lead to videos. This whole thing may be terrible and the fact that I’m nervous about that is utterly wonderful!</p>
<p>I have enjoyed thinking about something that’s not related to YouTube but is still something that I can share.</p>
<p>Long term, I would love to see this website be my main “creative” outlet, the place that people can go to read/listen to my thoughts on games and Linux. Because if I’m honest with myself, YouTube feels oppressive now!</p>
