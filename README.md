# HexDSL website

Mostly Pink and as neon as I can make it, this is my little home on the internet. It's all in HTML and CSS, I don't use any tracking tools or cookie or java-whatever. It's just here so you can read my thoughts if you want to.

I also house a file here for restoring my configuration (dot) files. You can get it like this

	curl -LO hexdsl.co.uk/hextool

But you shouldn't use it unless you are HexDSL!
